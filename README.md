# digital_helper_v2

This flutter projetc is the same as digital_helper.
The repository must have changed because I added web support for Flutter.

The goal of this project is to build a crossplatform chatting app with flutter and php/MySQL for api/db.
You can register as a "Teacher" or a "Student" and chose any category you're good at or want to lear from.
